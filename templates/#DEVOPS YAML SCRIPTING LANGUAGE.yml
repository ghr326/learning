#the installation fo tom cat in different servers
#orchestration of a servers 
# incase web servers and we are runnign some web logic or webssserver we need some data base to run 
#for the application

# ansible run the tasks in a systematic manner 
# #dependencies jobs can also done by the ansible
# it is used for the application deployment  configuration orchestration 
# it is not the best way for the provisioning we can use terraform 
# comparing with other tools it will save lot of time
# compare to other configuration tools we dont need agent should be installed in client machine
# ansible is a open source 
# we can use ansible for the infrastucture provisioning purpose
# default protocol in the linux systems ansibel uses ssh for the operations
# systems requirement are very low
# we need pyhton onlyfor the ansible
# it is devolopped with python
# we can write ruby as well
# fast deployment than other
